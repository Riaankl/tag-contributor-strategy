Contributor Strategy is a [Technical Advisory Group](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/tags/cncf-tags.md) (TAG) responsible for contributor experience, sustainability, governance, and openness guidance to help CNCF community groups
and projects with their own contributor strategies for a healthy project.


For people new to this space, you can learn more about the purpose, objectives, and responsibilities of [CNCF TAGs](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/tags/cncf-tags.md).

The [TAG Contributor Strategy charter](/CHARTER.md) outlines the scope of our group activities. To get involved, our [Contributing Guide](/CONTRIBUTING.md) lays out more details.
